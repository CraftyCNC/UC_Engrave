# UC_Engrave

UC_Engrave, a font to GCode engraving plugin for UCCNC.  This is provided as a demo of writing a plugin for UCCNC.  This plugin takes text input, 
a selection of any font you have on your computer, and creates a very quick and dirty GCode that can be loaded into UCCNC directly.

At present, it does only a simple 'engrave' of the exterior outline of the font.  The text may include multi lines, can be left/center/right justified,
and you may set absolute height or width of the engraved text.  

This code is based upon an original 'font to GCode' source code  by: Jim Steinbrecher (24 Nov 2011), with many modifications, corrections, and tailoring
to suit being a UCCNC plugin.

This is provided with no garantees, and may be used or modified as you wish.
